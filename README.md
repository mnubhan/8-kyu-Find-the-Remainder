# 8-kyu-Find-the-Remainder
Write a function that accepts two integers and returns the remainder of dividing the larger value by the smaller value.
<br><br>
Division by zero should return NaN.
<br><br>
Examples:
<br>
n = 17
<br>
m = 5
<br>
result = 2 (remainder of `17 / 5`)
<br><br>
n = 13
<br>
m = 72
<br>
result = 7 (remainder of `72 / 13`)
<br><br>
n = 0
<br>
m = -1
<br>
result = 0 (remainder of `0 / -1`)
<br><br>
n = 0
<br>
m = 1
<br>
result - division by zero (refer to the specifications on how to handle this in your language)
